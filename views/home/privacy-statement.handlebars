                <p>We respect every individual's right to privacy as much as we aim to ensure personal data protection

                <h3>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>
                    When you come to SFCMC, information about you, your medical treatment and family background are
                    recorded, on paper and computer, to help us care for you. The information is part of your health
                    record and will be kept in case we need to see you again. Members of the clinical teams looking
                    after you may share your personal health information with each other. This team may include
                    healthcare professionals, support staff, partners and interns/students. All SFCMC staff are bound by
                    law and a strict code of confidentiality. Your confidentiality is very important to us, and we have
                    strict controls in place to protect your information.
                </p>

                <h3>USE OF CCTV</h3>
                <p>
                    We employ surveillance cameras (CCTV) on and around the hospital site in order to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a. protect staff, patients, visitors, and property</li>
                    <li>b. provide a deterrent effect and reduce unlawful activity</li>
                    <li>c. monitor operation and safety-related incidents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we have to pass on information by law:</p>

                    necessary, and if we need your consent we will ask you for it. The organizations which may need your
                    information are your Insurance Provider, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), Department
                    of Health (DOH) and partners of SFCMC in giving medical services.

                <p>


                    In addition, information may be used for approved research projects. In most instances, the
                    information will be made anonymous so that you cannot be identified. If this is not possible, we
                    will ask your permission and approval.
